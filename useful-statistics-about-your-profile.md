There are a variety of tools available in our classified software. Since our 2.6.0 version, we have improved the statistics panel, displaying data that will be useful and valuable to you.

## Site Stats

**Site Statistics** are available in your Admin Panel -> Panel -> Stats. You will be able to view the following: number of ads, contact details, new users, paid orders, sales and visits to your site.

**Follow these steps to see the stats of each of your advertisements:**
