A new option for your website's users is now available. It enables users to mark and save their favorite ads to provide a better experience value to your website. I personally find it very useful when browsing a classifieds website.

To **add an advertisement to your favorites**, open an ad and press the heart shaped button as shown below.

Note that the highlight color should be red. If you press the button the next time and the icon change the color to white, the ad will not be included in your list of favorites.

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/favorites.png" class="thumbnail gallery-item" data-gallery>
![favorites]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/favorites.png)
</a>

<br>
To see all of the advertisements you chose, click the dropdown menu next to the profile icon, then you have to click on **My Favorites** and that's it.

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/favorites1.png" class="thumbnail gallery-item" data-gallery>
![favorites]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/favorites1.png)
</a>

<br>
You can easily delete an ad from the list of favorites. To remove it, just select the ad and then press the red button.
