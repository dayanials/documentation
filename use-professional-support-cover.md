If you made a purchase of a **[premium theme](https://selfhosted.yclas.com/themes/)** or **[hosting with our affiliates](https://yclas.com/self-hosted.html)**, you would need to access our professional support system for your classifieds website. If you don't know how, you are in the right place.

### Hosting clients

If you purchased a hosting for your classified ads website and you didn't get your free theme yet, then please refer to this guide.

After you're done with the previous step, we are certain that an user account has already been created for the e-mail you provided us with. **Check your e-mail** (check spam folder as well) and follow the links from the e-mails sent by us. You will be able to create a new password and your user will be 100% setup.

### Premium themes purchase clients

Once you purchase a theme for your classifieds website, an user account will be automatically created. **Check your e-mail** (check spam folder as well) and follow the links from the e-mails sent by us. You will be able to complete your registration if you haven't already.
