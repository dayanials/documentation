This guide explains how to configure your 2checkout account so it works with your Yclas website. 

First of all, you need to create an account on [2checkout](https://www.2checkout.com/). Enter your personal/business details to activate your account, and then go to your dashboard and click **Account** -> **Site Management**.

Now, you have to follow these instructions:

+ Select the **Pricing Currency** you want to use.
+ Select **Refund Policy** and **Privacy Policy**.
+ Choose **Header Redirect (Your URL)**.
+ Enter http://yourdomain.com/twocheckout/pay/null/ in **Approved URL** field.

Login to your website as admin, go to **Settings** -> **Payment**, **2checkout** and fill **Account Number** and then **Secret Word** fields. You can find these values in your 2checkout dashboard (see the image below).
