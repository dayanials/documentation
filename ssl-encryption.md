With SSL encryption, you give to your customers an extra step of security. It's not mandatory but you will need it to auto locate customers and to use many payment gateways like Stripe, etc.

We will set a SSL certificate that isn't provided by us. To do this, you will need to change your DNS and point them to the ones we will send you.

Be sure your plan does include SSL encryption before requesting us.

How to get an SSL certificate for your domain:

+ Be sure you have a plan with SSL on Yclas.com
+ Register at Cloudflare.com (its is free!)
+ Point your domain name to the DNS that cloudflare provides you
+ Activate a Flexible SSL as shown in the image below
