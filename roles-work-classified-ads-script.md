At some stage, after the development of your classifieds website, you will need to **delegate other people to do some work** for you, from translation and content creation to moderation and website administration.

With our open source classifieds script you can do that easily! Let's make an example of setting things up for a person to whom we will delegate work to create content on our classifieds website.

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/roles.png" class="thumbnail gallery-item" data-gallery>
![Roles1]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/roles.png)
</a>

1. First, go to your classifieds website **Admin Panel** 
2. Go to **Users** > **Roles** 
3. Create a **New Role** and press **Submit** 

<br><br>

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/roles1.png" class="thumbnail gallery-item" data-gallery>
![Roles2]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/roles1.png)
</a>

<br><br>

4\. **Edit** the newly created role<br>

5\. You will find a long list of **privileges**, pick the ones you need to give access to and press **Update**. The person helping you can **create a new user** or you can create one for him or her. 

1. Go to **Users** > **Users** in your **Admin Panel** 
2. Edit his account 
3. Change his role to the new one you created 
4. Done! <br><br>

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/roles2.png" class="thumbnail gallery-item" data-gallery>
![Roles3]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/roles2.png)
</a>

- messages.*
