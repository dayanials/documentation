Sometimes, an user purchases a hosting plan at some company then downloads Yclas and tries to run it on his website but he gets surprised with unexpected errors. Usually, this happens because of an incompatible hosting with Yclas. To prevent that from happening, and with Chema's help, we prepared a list of 16 hosting providers that we tested to confirm that they work with Yclas. We also included a list of tested hosting providers that are not working with Yclas.

## Tested Hosting Working With Yclas

These hosting providers have been all tested by us and we saw the software working fine with them:

1. **[Inmotion](https://inmotion-hosting.evyy.net/c/458796/260033/4222?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.inmotionhosting.com%2Fbusiness-hosting)**
2. **[A2hosting](https://partners.a2hosting.com/solutions.php?id=4636)**

## Tested hosting Not working with Yclas

These web hosting providers have been tested and all proved not to work with Yclas at the date of posting this article (some may change in time.

1. iPage
2. fatcow
3. godaddy windows based hosting
4. 000webhost
5. hostgator
6. Any other windows hosting is not recommended

My personal recommendation would be **Inmotion Hosting** if you're in the US, and **A2 hosting** if you're in Europe, Middle-east and North Africa. They're both good with 24/7 tech support, all companies have pros and cons but I feel comfortable when dealing with those two companies.

If you didn't find your web hosting on any of the two lists then make sure it's compatible with Yclas by checking the [software requirements]({{ site.baseurl }}/yclas-hosting/).
