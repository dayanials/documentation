With [Stripe Connect](https://stripe.com/connect), we will allow you to easily create a marketplace where you can earn commissions from products sold on your site.

# Marketplace with Stripe Connect

With [Stripe Connect](https://stripe.com/connect), you will be able to charge your customers an application fee (percentage) based on the sales they made using your platform. You (the site owner) and your customer (the publisher), will need a Stripe account.

### Example

You (site owner) set your site to get 3% commission for each sale made via your website. Your customer (publisher) posts an advertisement selling his services for the value of $100. Once this customer sells his product to a customer (product buyer), your customer (publisher) will receive $97 and you (site owner) will get immediately $3 on sale commission in your stripe account.

### Prerequisites

+ Configure your site to user Stripe Connect. Check it bellow!
+ Your customer needs to have a different Stripe account to receive payments.

### Payment flow

1. Buyer pays for a product listed on your site
2. Stripe receives the money
3. Your customer (publisher) receives its part in his Stripe account
4. You (site owner) will get from his stripe account the fee you set in your stripe account
5. 2 orders are created, 1 with the amount paid by the buyer and another with the fee paid by the publisher to you as application fee.
6. Buyer and seller get an email with the transaction details

### Site configuration

1. The site owner needs a **Stripe account** which is free.
2. **Create an application [here](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/applications/settings)**
