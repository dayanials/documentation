When you get a [premium theme](https://selfhosted.yclas.com/themes/), [hosting](https://yclas.com/self-hosted.html) or [professional support](https://selfhosted.yclas.com/support/) you receive a year of professional support. You gain access to our support system, which you can use to open tickets and communicate directly with the Yclas team, so we can help you with any inquiry. In this guide, I will explain how you can use the support system to serve your purposes and get an answer in a timely manner by following these steps:

### Client login

When you purchase a premium theme, you receive an e-mail with a link to download your purchase, as well as a notification e-mail to let you know that an account has been created with your e-mail at our market.

So you can use your purchase e-mail to **[log in to our market](https://selfhosted.yclas.com/oc-panel/auth/login)** and see a panel that looks like this:

![panel](//open-eshop.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/OE-panel-1024x184.png)

<br>
Please remember that you should use your purchase e-mail to log into our market if you want to get support, access your purchases or check your licenses.

### Opening a ticket

Once you are logged into your account at our market you should be able to see a _"support"_ tab at the left side of your panel. Once you click in it, you will find the button **"New"**.

![New ticket](//open-eshop.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/New-ticket1-1024x224.png)

When you click "New", a ticket opening panel comes up, in which you nust type a title and describe whatever you need help with.

If the issue requires more characters than the current 1000 Character limit, you can post a part of your issue first and then reply to the same ticket with the rest of the issue.

### Replying to a ticket

Remember that you have to be logged in with your purchase e-mail to access the support ticket. Once you do that, you will see a list of all the opened tickets with their status: "Opened", "Held" or "Closed". A ticket is on _"hold"_ status when you receive a reply from one of the support agents.

![ticket list](//open-eshop.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Hold-ticket-1024x260.png)

To reply, click on the message shaped button next to the ticket and the reply form will open with all of the previous messages.

![ticket reply](//open-eshop.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/reply-to-ticket-1024x531.png)

From there, you can read the full ticket conversation, close your ticket or place a reply.
