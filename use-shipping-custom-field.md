![shipping field](//docs.yclas.com/images/shipping-field.png)
</a>

After you create the field and once a seller posts his advertisement, he will be able set the price for shipping by filling this field. Then, on the checkout page, the shipping cost will be displayed after the item price. Finally, the order will be the shipping cost plus the item price.

Remember, it's very important to name this field **"shipping"**!

Now users can choose if their product is available for shipping, pick up or both. What you need to do is to create a custom checkbox field called **shipping_pickup**, as it's indicated below:

![shipping field](//docs.yclas.com/images/shipping_pickup_cf.png)
</a>

This field will add an option in the "Publish new" form.
