New feature is included in **2.0.7** version.

This feature creates a window for the  **Access Terms**, which allows or denies user's access to the website. Unless the owner approves it, the access to the website is denied and the user will be redirected outside of your website.

To activate this feature go to **Admin Panel** and create new page. Click on the **Content** > **Page** options, then click on the blue button **New**. If you are not sure on how to create a new page, find out how to do it [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/how_to_add_pages)!

After you have created a new page, go to **Settings > General** and find the option **Accept Terms Alert**. Then, in one of the following options, should be your new page. Select it and click on the **Save** button to finish the process.
